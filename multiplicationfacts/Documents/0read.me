# Multiplication Facts iOS App

## Project Overview
An iOS application designed to help users practice and master multiplication facts through interactive testing and gamified learning. The app aims to make multiplication practice engaging and effective for students, offering various difficulty levels and learning modes.

## Goals and Objectives
- Create an intuitive, user-friendly interface for practicing multiplication facts
- Provide progressive difficulty levels to accommodate different learning stages
- Track user progress over time to show improvement
- Implement gamification elements to make learning enjoyable
- Support different learning styles through varied test formats

## Core Features
- **Multiplication Tables**: Practice specific multiplication tables (1-12)
- **Mixed Practice Mode**: Random questions from selected tables
- **Timed Challenges**: Test speed and accuracy under time pressure
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual statistics showing improvement over time
- **Achievement System**: Badges and rewards for reaching milestones
- **Customizable Difficulty**: Options for easier or more challenging questions

## Technical Requirements
- iOS 16.0+ compatibility
- Swift 5.7+ and SwiftUI for modern UI implementation
- Core Data for local progress storage
- Haptic feedback for interactive experience
- Accessible design following Apple's Human Interface Guidelines

## User Experience Flow
1. User selects practice mode (specific tables, mixed practice, timed challenge)
2. User customizes difficulty and settings
3. App presents multiplication questions in engaging format
4. User submits answers and receives immediate feedback
5. Session results are displayed with performance metrics
6. Progress is tracked and achievements are awarded
